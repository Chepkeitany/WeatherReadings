First, ensure you have python 2.7 and above installed
To run the code in this project, type `python weather.py`


You should expect to see such an output:
`9 54`
The above shows the day of the month, 9th, which had the maximum spread of 54.


Assumptions:
- The order of data in the .dat file will always be the same i.e day of the
month followed by MxT then MnT etc.
- The * in some of the temperature readings represents an approximate value.
This value was removed for purposes of doing the arithmetic calculations.
